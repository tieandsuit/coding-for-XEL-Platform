# XEL BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS
The XEL Blockchain is the heart of XEL. Every Transaction ever made is recorded on the Blockchain.
The Blockchain is a decentralized database, which is saved on your computer.
To prevent spam, for every transaction you have to pay fees in the native currency, which will be XEL for us using the XEL Blockchain.
Throughout the article I want to focus on tools you can use while creating Transactions on XEL.

# SEND XEL
Codewise, creating a transaction on XEL is very similar to reading data from the Blockchain;
There are some topics we have to cover before creating our first tranasction.
To create a transaction, we first need a XEL Account and some XEL, in order to pay for Blockchain fees. So, let us login to XEL and create our first account.

# CREATE A XEL ACCOUNT
In order to have a secure XEL account, you need a strong passphrase. Working With virtual currencies we use the term passphrase instead of password, this describes strong entropy and should be more secure than a regular password. When you are using the official XEL Client, you can use the implemented passphrase creation function, which will give you a passphrase which contains 12 words.

# CREATE YOUR XEL PASSPHRASE
You can also create your own passphrase, make sure it contains enough characters and entropy. To generate a passphrase it is recommended to use Software such as KeePass, LastPass, Dashlane or Online Tools as PasswordsGenerator.net or Fourmilab.ch.

# XEL PASSPHRASE GENERATOR
When running XEL on http://localhost:17876 you will get to the client, a click on the link quoting
